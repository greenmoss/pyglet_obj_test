pyglet obj test
===============

Test importing .obj files into pyglet. Derived from `contrib/model/examples/obj_test.py` in the pyglet directory. I'm making a git repository to figure out how to make this work generically with [NotOrion](https://github.com/greenmoss/NotOrion)

Usage
=====
Install python, then `pip install hg+https://pyglet.googlecode.com/hg/`. As of December 30, 2012, that is version 1.2alpha1.

- To see an example: `./obj_test.py rabbit.obj`
