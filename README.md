pyglet obj test
===============

Test importing .obj files into pyglet. Derived from `contrib/model/examples/obj_test.py` in the pyglet directory. I'm making a git repository to figure out how to make this work generically with [NotOrion](https://github.com/greenmoss/NotOrion)

Usage
=====
- To see a working example: `./obj_test.py rabbit.obj`
- To see a failing example: `./obj_test.py asteroid.obj`

Hopefully I will be able to figure out why it's failing and fix it.
